# reverseX-cipher 
The [ReverseX Cipher](https://reverse-x-cipher-by-shovan-prita-paul.netlify.app/)is a symmetric-key cryptography algorithm employing the XNOR operation for encryption and decryption. It reverses the plaintext before applying XNOR encryption with a designated key. Decryption reverses the process, first applying XNOR decryption and then reversing the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext.
