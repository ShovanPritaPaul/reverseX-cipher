# reverseX-cipher
The "ReverseX Cipher" is a symmetric-key cryptography algorithm employing the XNOR operation for encryption and decryption. It reverses the plaintext before applying XNOR encryption with a designated key. Decryption reverses the process, first applying XNOR decryption and then reversing the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext.
